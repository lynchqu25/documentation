## Build a Use Case

Welcome to the bonus mission of Discord missions!
Submit a PR to our documentation under this section and provide a potential use case that Centrifuge can tap into, using the following categories:

- **Through the lens of an asset originator**
  - Which markets around the world could benefit most from asset financing through centrifuge?
  - Car rental companies:
There are numerous car rental companies that operate around the world- both large corporations and small local enterprises. Car rental companies buy cars in a large volume directly from the manufacturers in a process known as Fleet Sales. Since they cut out the middleman, they do not pay a dealer's markup. In addition, they receive a volume discount from the manufacturers. The end result is that they get the cars at such a discount, that they can sell them at the end of the year as still relatively new cars, for about the same price they paid for it. This way, the rental companies get the cars essentially for free. However, they still need to produce the capital, through a loan, to buy the cars off the car manufacturers. There are many car rental companies that buy cars using long term, medium term and short term loans. This is where Centrifuge could step in and be very beneficial to raise capital for the car rental companies- allowing them to buy the cars needed. The Tinlake pool could finance a portfolio of car buying loans that are extended to car rental companies with a maturity of twelve to twenty four months depending on the timeframe of selling on the cars. The assets i.e. car purchase invoices could be originated onto the Centrifuge chain via tokenization. This could mean the physical world document would be replicated as an NFT, through a smart contract, and represents the document's inherent value. This could go from a NFT per order or get quite granular down to a per car level.

- **DeFi protocol composability**
  - Centrifuge has started working with MakerDAO and Aave to create instant liquidity for Tinlake pools. What are other great partnership use cases for Centrifuge?
  - I feel like a parnership with cover would be highly beneficial to help get more people on board as it could provide further reassurance and support for investors about their investment. As we all know Cover Protocol is a peer-to-peer insurance market, where the way it operates is more similar to prediction market. Unlike other insurance protocols, the governance token is not used for underwriting risk. To bootstrap coverage for a new investment pool, investors could be incentivized by being given the option to add further coverage to their investment guaranteeing their initial investment. All series covers a specified investment pool and have a specified expiry date in line with that pool. If there is no incident with the pool the extra fee paid could be then pooled and used to add value to the ecosystem as a whole.

For example, if someone wants to add liquidity to a pool they have the option of insuring their investment against any loss by paying an extra fee- that fees goes into a pool and is used in some way

- **Centrifuge Chain (the home for RWA)**
  - Centrifuge Chain is built for RWA origination. Tinlake is a great use case of what can be done with the Centrifuge chain. What are some other cases you can see for the Centrifuge chain?
  - With the push for more sustainability in products by the consumer, using centrifuge to help in the tracibility of raw materials ensuring a fair and reflective supply chain would be a massive positive effect that centrifuge could have as a whole. Not too sure how applicable this is to the centrifuge chain- 
- **Polkadot**
  - Interoperability is crucial for DeFiâ€™s success. What are some other projects in the Polkadot ecosystem that you think Centrifuge should integrate with? I think I massive one will be ChainX- this is going to be the main gateway for BTC onto the polkadot ecosystem so having some sort of intergration with it would allow easier access for that liquidity into Tinlake etc.

For any of these categories above ðŸ‘‰ submit a PR to detail how each use case could work. Make sure to think about the entire flow, technology, and size of the potential!
